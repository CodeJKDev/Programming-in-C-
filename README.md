Dear students,

First i wanna apologize for the incorrect repository name earlier. Don't worry; this is where we will begin learning C++ programming.


C++ is powerfull programming language that is an extension of C. While C is simpler and focuses on core programming concepts, C++ offers more complexity with advanced features like object-oriented programming, which makes it ideal for large and modern projects.


If you are just starting, I recommended learning C programming first because it provides a strong foundation. However, if you're ready to dive into C++ ( which is constantly receives updates and is widely used today), this repository will help you get started.


Here, we will explore key C++ programming concepts step-by-step. Whether you are:
  - 1. New to programming and want to learn it from scratch,
    2. Experienced with C and want to transition to C++, or
    3. Solving specific problems or working on personnal projects


I will be uploading specific, files, scripts, and examples to help you understand programming concepts. If you have questions, you can contact me via Email ( listed below ). I will respond quickly as possible. I'm also working on setting up Discord server for better communication and community support.


Please note that everything is still in development. I will update projects, scripts and notes as I get more time. Make sure to check back frequently for updates. To make things easier, I will include timestamps and update logs to help you keep track for changes.


Programming is all about practice and problem-solving. By learning C++, you'll gain skills needed to build efficient and scalable applications. I will also provide additional resources, explanations, and small projects to help you solidify your learning.


Feel free to share your progress, ask questions, and collobrate with others once the Discord server is ready. Let's start this journey into C++ programming together!


Stay tuned for updates, and happy coding!
